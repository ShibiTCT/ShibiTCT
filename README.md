- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShibiTCT (I also go by shibithecatthing on some social media, you may know me by name if your from facebook)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working on CATE (Canine Access To Education). This is a personal project of mine which uses gitpages. CATE is currently a website for information and resources on assistance dogs within the UK. This is the main place to report any issues or give feedback for the site.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m know basic HTML and W3.CSS which is what CATE is primarily made with. I also know basic python. I am looking to learn JS to add to the website more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me either through Twitter (@ShibiTCT) or Instagram (@shibithecatthing). You can also contact me through FB if you know my account. There may later be a discord for comments on CATE.
